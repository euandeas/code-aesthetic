# Naming

## Summary

- Don't use single letter variable names
- Don't abbreviate
- Don't put types in names
- Add units in variable names unless the type tells you
- Don't put types in your types
- Don't name a class with "Base" or "Abstract"
- Don't name code "Utils", refactor into modules with good names

## Notes

- If your struggling to name something it may be indicative that the code structure is to blame
